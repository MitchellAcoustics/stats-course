In this problem set you'll practice fitting and evaluating two different predictive models. You can load in the data with the following code.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
train <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/idc9/course-materials/main/3-prediction/14-overfitting/train.csv')

test <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/idc9/course-materials/main/3-prediction/14-overfitting/test.csv')
```


#### Question 1

Fit a simple linear model to the training data that that predicts y as a function of x. Use this model to calculate a training and testing $R^2$.

#### Question 2

Fit a polynomial model to the training data that that predicts y as a function of x. Use this model to calculate a training and testing $R^2$. The choice of the degree of the polynomial is up to you.

#### Question 3

How did the testing and training $R^2$s compare between the linear and the polynomial models? What is driving the difference in these statistics between these two models?
