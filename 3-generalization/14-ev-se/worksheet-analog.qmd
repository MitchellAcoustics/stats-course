#### Question 1  expected value from cdf of $X$
Given the cdf of the random variable $X$ below, compute $E(X)$ and $Var(X)$.

#### Question 2: sums of random variables

A discrete random variable $X$ takes values from $-5$ to $5$ and has expectation $0$ ($E(X) = 0$). You have two choices: 
(i) Consider $S_{100}$, the sum of $100$ random variables $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_{100}$ which are independent and have the same distribution as $X$. You will win a prize if $-15 \le S_{100} \le 15$. 
(ii) Consider $S_{200}$, the sum of $200$ random variables $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_{200}$ which are independent and have the same distribution as $X$. You will win a prize if $-30 \le S_{200} \le 30$.

Does option (i) give a better chance of winning a prize or option (ii)? Or are they the same? Is it even possible to answer this question without knowing $SD(X)$?

#### Question 3: expectations of linear transformations

Let $X$ be a random variable such that $E(X) = 4$. Let $Y = 2 + 3X$. What is $E(Y)$?

#### Question 4: continuous random variables

Consider the function $f(x)$ where:
$$
f(x) = \begin{cases}
x+1, \: -1 \le x \le 0\\
1-x, \: 0 \le x \le 1 \\
0, \: \text{ for all other }x
\end{cases}
$$

(a) Does $f$ satisfy the criteria to be a probability density function? (It should be non-negative and integrate to 1, that is, the total area under the curve is 1.)    
(b) What is your guess for $E(X)$, without doing any integration or summation?

#### Question 5 red tickets 

A box of 100 tickets contains 45 red tickets, 50 blue tickets,
  and 5 yellow tickets. Twenty tickets will be drawn from this box at
  random, \textit{without} replacement. What is the expected number of red tickets in the sample?
