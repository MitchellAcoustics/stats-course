They then recorded the whether each subject yawned (`response`: `yawn`) or not (`response`: `no yawn`).\n\n(@) What is the explanatory variable?

Find out by *simulating* the process.\n\n1. Create a deck of cards, 36 of which represent subjects who did not yawn, 14 of which represent subjects who yawned.\n\n2. Shuffle the deck of cards to simulate the process of randomly assignment to the two conditions: being exposed to a yawn (stimulus) and not being exposed (no stimulus).\n\n3. Deal them into two decks of size 16 and 34, representing the 1/3 of the subjects that were assigned to the no stimulus group and the 2/3 assigned to the stimulus group.\n\n4. Calculate the difference in the proportion of yawners in the two group, $\\hat{p}_s - \\hat{p}_{n}$, and record it below.\n\n5. Repeat process 5 more times and sketch the distribution of simulated statistics from the class in the blank plot.\n\n\\renewcommand{\\arraystretch}{1.5}\n\n\n::: {.cell layout=\"[[15,-5,45]]\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begin{tabular}{r|l}\n\\hline\nSim & $\\hat{p}_s - \\hat{p}_{n}$\\\\\n\\hline\n1 & \\\\\n\\hline\n2 & \\\\\n\\hline\n3 & \\\\\n\\hline\n4 & \\\\\n\\hline\n5 & \\\\\n\\hline\n6 & \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](worksheet-analog_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-2-1.pdf)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n(@) If there was in fact no relationship between yawning and the stimulus, what values of the statistic would you expect to see?\n\n\\\n\\\n\n(@)  What value of $\\hat{p}_s - \\hat{p}_{n}$ did the MythBusters actually observe?\n\n\\\n\\\n\n(@) Is this data convincing evidence that yawning is contagious?
