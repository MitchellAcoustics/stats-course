When we were only interested in a particular outcome, such as a die roll resulting in the face with six spots, or the coin landing heads - we could model it as a box with tickets marked $0$ or $1$. We did not need tickets with other values, since we were just counting the number of times we rolled a six, or the number of heads when we tossed a coin. We saw that in our simulation of the Chevalier de Méré's game, we only needed to define the appropriate $0$-$1$ vector from which we would sample. We associated each outcome with a real number.\n\n## Random variables\n\nWhat we did, in fact, was define a function that assigned a real number to each possible outcome in $\\Omega$. In our simulation, if $\\Omega$ was all possible outcomes when we roll a fair six-sided die, we assigned the outcome \"six spots\" to the real number $1$, and all other outcomes to the number $0$. By sampling over and over again from this box, we got a sequence of $0$'s and $1$'s that was *randomly generated* by our sampling, and then we could do arithmetic on this sequence, such as compute the proportion of times we sampled $1$. To put it in mathematical notation:\n\n$$ X : \\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$$\n\n$X$ is called a *random variable*: variable, because it takes different values on the real line, and random, because it inherits the randomness from the generating process. In the example above, the process is drawing from the box ![](images/de-mere-die-1.png){width=\"150\"}.\n\nRandom variable\n: A random variable is a function that associates real numbers with outcomes from a random experiment, which are in an outcome space $\\Omega$. These numbers have probabilities coming from the probability distribution on $\\Omega$. The range of the random variable, usually denoted by $X, Y, \\ldots$ is the set of all the possible values that $X$ can take. \nThe set of possible values of $X$, along with their associated probabilities, is called the *probability distribution* for the random variable $X$. We write statements about the values $X$ takes, such as $X = 1$ or $X = 0$. Note that $X = 1$ is an *event* and it may be true or not. The probability of such events is written as $P(X = x)$, where $x$ is a real number.\n\n\n![](images/rv-picture.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"600\"}\n\n\nDiscrete and continuous random variables\n: Discrete random variables are restricted to take *particular* values in an interval, they cannot take just any value, as opposed to continuous random variables which can take any value in some specified interval. Note the similarity to discrete and continuous quantitative data types. \n\nExamples of discrete random variables \n: - The number of heads in $3$ tosses of a fair coin\n- The number of tosses until the coin lands heads for the first time\n- The number of people that arrive at an ATM in a day\n\nExamples of continuous random variables \n: - Time between consecutive people arriving at an ATM\n- Price of a stock\n- Height of a randomly selected stat 20 student\n\n\n#### Example: Making bets on red in Roulette\n\n![](images/roulette-us.jpg){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"400\"}\n\nThe roulette wheels used in Las Vegas have 38 numbered slots, numbered from $1$ to $36$, of which 18 are colored red, and 18 black. There are two green slots numbered with zero and a double zero. As the wheel spins, a ball is sent spinning in the opposite direction. When the wheel slows the ball will land in one of the numbered slots. Players can make various bets on where the ball lands, among them is betting on red or black. If a player bets one dollar on red, and ball lands on red, then they win a dollar, in addition to getting their stake back. If the ball does not land on red, then they loses their dollar to the casino. Suppose a player bets six times on six consecutive spins, betting on red each time. Their *net gain* can be defined as the amount they won minus the amount they lost. Is net gain a random variable? What are its possible values (write down how much the player can win or lose in one spin of the wheel, then two, and so on)? \n\n<details> <summary> Check your answer </summary>\n\nYes, net gain *is* a random variable, and its possible values are: $-6, -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, 6$. (Why?)\n\n</details>\n\n\n### The probability distribution of a random variable $X$\n\nWe can list the values taken by a random variable, along with the probability that the variable takes a particular value in a table. This table is called the distribution table of the random variable. For example, let $X$ be the number of heads in $3$ tosses of a fair coin. Fill out the values and probabilities for the probability distribution table for $X$. The first column should have the possible values that $X$ can take, denoted by $x$, and the second column should have $P(X = x)$. Make sure that the probabilities add up to 1: $\\displaystyle \\sum_x P(X = x) = 1$.\n\n\n<details> <summary> Check your answer </summary>\n\n<center>\n\n\n| $x$ |  $P(X = x)$  |\n|:------:|:---------:|\n|  $0$  |  $\\displaystyle \\frac{1}{8}$ |\n|  $1$  | $\\displaystyle \\frac{3}{8}$ |\n|  $2$  | $\\displaystyle \\frac{3}{8}$ |   \n|  $3$  | $\\displaystyle \\frac{1}{8}$ |   \n\n</center>\n\n</details>\n \nThe probability mass function (pmf) of a discrete random variable $X$\n: The **pmf** of a discrete random variable $X$ is defined to be the function $f(x) = P(X = x)$.\n\nWe can write down the definition of the function $f(x)$ and it gives the same information as in the table:\n $$f(x) = \\begin{cases}\n          \\frac{1}{8}, \\; x = 0, 3 \\\\\n          \\frac{3}{8}, \\; x = 1, 2 \n  \\end{cases} \n$$  \n\nWe see here that $f(x) > 0$ for only $4$ real numbers, and is $0$ otherwise. We can think of the total probability mass as $1$, and $f(x)$ describes how this mass of $1$ is distributed among the real numbers. It is often easier and more compact to define the probability distribution of $X$ using $f$ rather than the table. \n\n\n## Special distributions\n\n### Bernoulli distribution\n\nThis is the simplest discrete distribution: $X$ be a random variable that takes the value $1$ with probability $p$ and the value $0$ with probability $1-p$, then $X$ is called a *Bernoulli* random variable. We say that $X$ is Bernoulli with parameter $p$, because if we know $p$, we can calculate the probabilities associated with $X$. We can visualize the distribution and the pmf using the probability histogram.\n\n![](images/bernoulli.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"500\"}\n\n\nParameter of a probability distribution\n: A constant(s) associated with the distribution. If you know the parameters of a probability distribution, then you can compute all the values of $f(x)$.\n\n\n### Discrete uniform random distribution\n\nLet's suppose $X$ takes the values $1, 2, 3, \\ldots, n$ with $P(X = k) = \\displaystyle \\frac{1}{n}$ for each of the $k$ from $1$ to $n$. We call $X$ a *discrete uniform* random variable, and the probability distribution is called the discrete uniform probability distribution: $P(X = k) = \\displaystyle \\frac{1}{n}$ for $1 \\le k \\le n$. (Think of die rolls.) If $X$ is the outcome when we roll a die, then $X$ is called the discrete uniform random variable with $n = 6$. In fact, the only thing we need to know, in order to compute the probability that $X$ will take a particular value is $n$. We call $n$ the *parameter* of the discrete uniform distribution.\n\n\n##### Rolling a pair of dice and summing the spots\nSuppose we roll a pair of dice and sum the spots, and let $X$ be the sum. Is $X$ a discrete uniform random variable?\n\n<details> <summary> Check your answer </summary>\n\nNo. $X$ takes discrete values: $2, 3, 4, \\ldots, 12$, but these are not equally likely.\n\n</details>\n\n### Binomial distribution\n\nSuppose a particular random experiment has two possible outcomes which we designate as a \"success\" or a \"failure\", where the probability of a success on any trial is $p$, regardless of what happens on any other trial. Suppose we repeat this experiment $n$ times, and let $X$ count the number of successes in $n$ trials of this random experiment (think tossing a coin $n$ times, and counting the number of heads). Then \n$$P(X = k ) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} $$\nwhere $k$ takes the values $0, 1, 2, \\ldots, n$, and $\\displaystyle \\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$ and is read as \"$n$ *choose* $k$\". These are called the binomial coefficients.[^binom]\n\nWe say that $X$ has the *binomial* distribution with parameters $n$ and $p$ and write this as $X \\sim Bin(n, p)$. Note that the Bernoulli distribution is a special case of the binomial, with $n = 1$.\n\n\n#### Example: Proportion of Californians that have had at least one positive COVID test.\nBased on the December 2022 report \"State of the COVID-19 Pandemic\"[^covid], about 35% of Americans reported having at least one positive COVID test. Suppose we survey 10 California residents, sampling them *with* replacement from a voters database, what is the probability that more than $3$ of the individuals in our sample would have had at least one positive COVID test?\n\n\nIn this example, since we are counting the number of individuals in our sample that have had at least one positive COVID test, such an individual would count as a \"success\", because a success is whatever outcome we are counting. We can now set up our random variable $X$: Let $X$ be the number of individuals in our sample who have had at least one positive COVID test. Then $X \\sim Bin(10, p = 0.35)$, and $P(X > 3) = 1 - P(X \\le 3) = 1 - \\left(P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2)\\right)$. Note that since these events are mutually exclusive, we can use the addition rule. This gives us:\n$$ P(X > 3) = 1 - \\left(\\binom{10}{0}(0.35)^0 (0.65)^{10} + \\binom{10}{1}(0.35)^1 (0.65)^9 + \\binom{10}{2}(0.35)^2 (0.65)^8\\right) \\approx 0.74$$\nIn `R` we can use a special function to compute the binomial probabilities $f(k) = P(X=k)$. It is called `dbinom(x, size, prob)` and takes as input the $k$ that we want (`x`), the number of trials $n$ (`size`), and $p$ (`prob`):\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"false\"}\n1 - dbinom(0, size = 10, prob = 0.35) - dbinom(1, size = 10, prob = 0.35) - \n  dbinom(2, size = 10, prob = 0.35)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.7383926\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs stated abov, we can define *events* by the values of random variables.\nFor example, let $X = Bin(10,0.4)$ What does this mean in words? What is $X$? Given this $X$, what are the following events in words?\n\n- $X = 5$\n- $X \\le 5$\n- $3 \\le X \\le 8$\n\nWhat are these events in words? What are their probabilities?\n\n<details> <summary> Check your answer </summary>\n- $X$ is the number of successes in ten trials, where the probability of success in each trial is 40%. $X = 5$ is the event that we see exactly five successes in the ten trial, while $X \\le 5$ is the event of seeing at most five successes in ten trials. The last event, $3 \\le X \\le 8$ is the event of at least three successes, but not more than eight, in ten trials.\nWe will use `dbinom()` to compute the probabilities.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"false\"}\n# P(X=5)\ndbinom(x = 5, size = 10, prob = 0.4)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.2006581\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"false\"}\n# P(X <= 5)\ndbinom(x = 0, size = 10, prob = 0.4) + dbinom(x = 1, size = 10, prob = 0.4) + \n  dbinom(x = 2, size = 10, prob = 0.4) + dbinom(x = 3, size = 10, prob = 0.4) +\n  dbinom(x = 4, size = 10, prob = 0.4) + dbinom(x = 5, size = 10, prob = 0.4)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.8337614\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"false\"}\n# P(3 <= X <= 8)\ndbinom(x = 3, size = 10, prob = 0.4) + dbinom(x = 4, size = 10, prob = 0.4) + \n  dbinom(x = 5, size = 10, prob = 0.4) + dbinom(x = 6, size = 10, prob = 0.4) +\n  dbinom(x = 7, size = 10, prob = 0.4) + dbinom(x = 8, size = 10, prob = 0.4)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.8310325\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n</details>\n\n### Hypergeometric distribution\n\nIn the example above, we sampled from the population of California *with* replacement. Usually we sample *without* replacement. Suppose our population consists of $N$ units. If, each time we draw a unit for our sample, all the units are equally likely to be drawn (just like in the box model), a sample drawn without replacement is called a *simple random sample*. Suppose our population consists of just two types of units that we call \"successes\" and \"failures\" (as usual, a \"success\" is whatever outcome we are interested in), and we draw a sample of size $n$ without replacement. Now, the probability of success will *not* stay the same on each draw. If we let $X$ be the number of successes in $n$ draws, then we have that \n\n$$ P(X = k) = \\frac{\\binom{G}{k} \\times \\binom{N-G}{n-k}}{\\binom{N}{n}} $$\nwhere $N$ is the size of the population, $G$ is the total number of successes in the population, and $n$ is the sample size (so $k$ can take the values $0, 1, \\ldots, n$ or $0, 1, \\ldots, G$, if the number of successes in the population is smaller than the sample size.)\n\n#### Example: Gender discrimination at large supermarket?\nA large (with 1,000 employees) supermarket chain in Florida occasionally selects employees\nto receive management training. A group of women there claimed that\nfemale employees were passed over for this training in favor of\ntheir male colleagues. The company denied this claim. \n(A similar complaint of gender bias was made about promotions and pay\nfor the 1.6 million women who work or who have worked for\nWal-Mart. The Supreme Court heard the case in 2011 and ruled in favor\nof Wal-Mart, in that it rejected the effort to sue Wal-Mart.)[^wm] If we set this up as a probability problem, we might ask the question of how many women have been selected for executive training in the last 10 years. Suppose no women had ever been selected in 10 years of annually selecting one employee for training. Further suppose that the number of men and women were equal, and suppose the company claims that it draws employees at random for the training, from the 1,000 eligible employees. If $X$ is the number of women that have been picked for training in the past 10 years, what is $P(X = 0)$?\n\nSince there are 1,000 employees, and half are women, we have $G = N-G = 500$. Of the 10 picked, none are women. We are picking a sample of size 10 without replacment, therefore we have that:\n$$P(X = 0) = \\frac{\\binom{500}{0} \\times \\binom{500}{10}}{\\binom{1000}{10}} \\approx 0.0009$$\n\nThe function that we can use in `R` to compute hypergeometric probabilities is called `dhyper(x, m, n, k)`, where `x` is the number of successes in the sample that we are counting (what we call $k$), `m` is $G$ or the number of successes in the population, and $n$ is $N-G$. $k$ is the sample size, $n$.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"false\"}\ndhyper(0, 500, 500, 10)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.0009331878\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNote that the function used in `R` to compute the binomial coefficient $\\binom{n}{k}$ is `choose(n,k)`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"false\"}\nchoose(500, 0)*choose(500, 10)/choose(1000, 10)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.0009331878\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### Binomial vs Hypergeometric distributions\n\nBoth these distributions deal with the counting the number of successes in a *fixed* number of *trials* (where each instance of the random experiment that generates a success or a failure is called a trial, for example each toss of a coin, or each card dealt from a deck, and we count a heart to be a success). The difference is that for a binomial random variable, the probability of a success stays the *same* for each trial, and for a hypergeometric random variable, the probability *changes* with each trial. If we use the box model, both distributions can be modeled by sampling from $0$-$1$ boxes, but for the binomial distribution, we sample $n$ times *with* replacement and count the number of successes by summing the draws; and for the hypergeometric distribution, we sample $n$ times *without* replacement, and count the number of successes by summing the draws.\n\n\n\n## The cumulative distribution function $F(x)$\n\nThe cumulative distribution function (cdf) $F(x)$\n: of a random variable $X$ is defined for *every* real number, and gives, for each $x$, the amount of probability or mass that has been *accumulated* up to (and including) the point $x$, that is, it is the probability that the value of $X$ is at most $x$: \n$F(x) = P(X \\le x)$\n\nFor example, if $X$ is the number of heads in $3$ tosses of a fair coin, recall that:\n\n$$ f(x) = \\begin{cases}\n  \\displaystyle \\frac{1}{8}, \\; x = 0, 3 \\\\\n  \\displaystyle \\frac{3}{8}, \\; x = 1, 2 \n  \\end{cases} $$\n\nIn this case, $F(x) = P(X\\le x) = 0$ for all $x < 0$ since the first positive probability is at $0$. Then, $F(0) = P(X \\le 0) = 1/8$ after which it stays at $1/8$ until $x = 1$. Look at the graph below:\n\n![](images/cdf.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"700\"}\nNotice that $F(x)$ is a step function, and right continuous. The jumps are at exactly the values for which $f(x) > 0$. We can get $F(x)$ from $f(x)$ by adding the values of $f$ up to and including $x$, and we can get $f(x)$ from $F(x)$ by looking at the size of the jumps. \n\n#### Example: Drawing the graph of the cdf\n\nLet $X$ be the random variable defined by the distribution table below. Find the cdf of $X$, and draw the graph, making sure to define $F(x)$ for all real numbers $x$. Before you do that, you will have to determine the value of $f(x)$ for $x = 4$.\n\n<center>\n\n\n| $x$ |  $P(X = x)$  |\n|:------:|:---------:|\n|  $-1$  |  $0.2$ |\n|  $1$  | $0.3$ |\n|  $2$  | $0.4$ |   \n|  $4$  | ??  |   \n\n</center>\n\n<details><summary> Check your answer </summary>\n\nSince $\\displaystyle \\sum_x P(X = x) = \\sum_x f(x) = 1$, $f(4) = 1-(0.2+0.3+0.4) = 0.1.$ Therefore $F(x)$ is as shown below.\n\n![](images/cdf-2.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"700\"}\n</details>\n\n\nIn `R`, we have functions that calculate $F(x)$ for some special distributions, including the binomial and hypergeometric distributions. For a binomial distribution, we use the function `pbinom(x, size, prob)` Similarly, for the hypergeometric distribution, we use `phyper(x, m, n, k)`.\n\nGoing back to the example above, let's compute the probabilities using `pbinom(x, 10, 0.4)` and compare them to the probabilities computed earlier using `dbinom(x, size, prob)` \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"false\"}\n# P(X = 5)\ndbinom(x = 5, size = 10, prob = 0.4)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.2006581\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"false\"}\n# P(X = 5)\npbinom(5, 10, 0.4) - pbinom(4, 10, 0.4)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.2006581\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"false\"}\n# P(X <= 5)\ndbinom(x = 0, size = 10, prob = 0.4) + dbinom(x = 1, size = 10, prob = 0.4) + \n  dbinom(x = 2, size = 10, prob = 0.4) + dbinom(x = 3, size = 10, prob = 0.4) +\n  dbinom(x = 4, size = 10, prob = 0.4) + dbinom(x = 5, size = 10, prob = 0.4)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.8337614\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"false\"}\n# P(X <= 5)\npbinom(5, 10, 0.4)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.8337614\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"false\"}\n# P(3 <= X <= 8)\ndbinom(x = 3, size = 10, prob = 0.4) + dbinom(x = 4, size = 10, prob = 0.4) + \n  dbinom(x = 5, size = 10, prob = 0.4) + dbinom(x = 6, size = 10, prob = 0.4) +\n  dbinom(x = 7, size = 10, prob = 0.4) + dbinom(x = 8, size = 10, prob = 0.4)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.8310325\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"false\"}\n# P(3 <= X <= 8)\npbinom(8, 10, 0.4) - pbinom(2, 10, 0.4)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.8310325\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhat is going on in the last expression?

As in the example above, we will plot the probability distribution of $X$ on the left, and the empirical distribution on the right. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbox <- c(0,1)\nbinom_30 <- seq(from = 0, to = 30, by = 1)\nprob_30 <- round(dbinom(binom_30, size = 30, prob = 0.5), 3)\n\nset.seed(12345)\n\nn_sims <- 10^6\n\ndraws <- replicate(n_sims, sum(sample(box, 30, replace = TRUE)))\n\np1 <- data.frame(binom_30) %>% \n  mutate(prob_30 = prob_30) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = factor(binom_30), y = prob_30)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"goldenrod2\", width = 0.98, color = \"white\") + \n   ylab(\"probability\") + \n   xlab(\" number of successes\") + \n  ggtitle(\"Probabilities for the binomial random variable \\n n = 30, p = 0.5\") +\n  theme_bw()\n  \n\nfac_30 <- factor(binom_30, levels = 0:30)\n\np2 <- data.frame(draws) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x=draws)) + \n  geom_bar(aes(y=..prop..), fill=\"blue\", width = 0.98, color = \"white\") + \n  ylab(\"proportion of draws\") + \n  xlab(\"sum of draws\") + \n  ggtitle(\"Empirical distribution for random numbers generated \\n\n          from the (30, 0.5) distribution\")  +\n  theme_bw() +\n  scale_x_discrete(limits = factor(seq(0,30)), labels = fac_30, drop = FALSE)\n  \n\np1 + p2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](notes_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n[^covid]: <https://www.covidstates.org/reports/state-of-the-covid-19-pandemic>\n[^wm]:<https://www.latimes.com/world/la-xpm-2011-jun-20-la-naw-wal-mart-court-20110621-story.html>\n[^binom]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient>\n\n## Summary\n\n- In these notes, we defined random variables, and described discrete and continuous random variables.\n- For any random variable, there is an associated probability distribution, and this is described by the probability mass function or pmf $f(x)$. We also defined a function that, for a random variable $X$, and any real number $x$, describes all the probability that is to the left of $x$. This function is called the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of $X$ and is denoted $F(x)$.\n- We looked at some special distributions (Bernoulli, binomial, discrete uniform, and hypergeometric)\n- Finally, we looked at connections between random variables and box models, and saw how to simulate some empirical distributions.\n\n\n\n## Materials from class\n\n#### Slides\n\n- [Andrew](slides.qmd)\n- [Silas](https://silas.quarto.pub/random-variables)\n- [Shobhana](slides.qmd)\n- [Jeremy](https://sanchez.quarto.pub/random-variables)\n\n#### Worksheet\n\n- [Worksheet - Analog](worksheet-analog.qmd)\n\n",
