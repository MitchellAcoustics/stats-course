They will become part of the next problem set. The slides introduce / practice several functions used here. -->\n\n<!-- Suggesting timeline: -->\n\n<!-- 1. Review functions in slides -->\n<!-- 2. Motivate setting: what if we only had data on 100 flights? How confident could we be that we have good estimates of the population parameters. -->\n<!-- 3. Make students work in at least pairs for the handout. Ask that they draw their confidence intervals for the mean on the front board. You'll want to pre-populate the axes carefully and probably have them draw their intervals vertically so that they will all fit. Draw one on the board to demonstrate. -->\n<!-- 3. At the end of the class period, review answers. -->\n\n<!-- Technical Notes -->\n\n<!-- 1. In the notes, the SE is the true SE calculated from the population (sigma / sqrt(n) for the mean). Here, we have them just use the data, so they use s / sqrt(n)) -->\n\nThe goal of these practice problems is to experiment with the notion of a sampling distribution and confidence intervals. In any applied setting, you only have access to a sample of the data, but for these practice problems we'll work with a data set where we have access to the full population: the flights data set. Here your goal is to use a small sample from that population to estimate two population parameters: a mean and a standard deviation.\n\n\n#### Question 1\n\nOur goal is to estimate the population mean of the air time variable using a small sample of the flights data. Load the `flights` data from the `stat20data` package that you used in Lab 4.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(stat20data)\ndata(flights)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThen:\n\n- Set a seed of your choosing\n- Take a random sample of 100 flights from `flights`\n- Plot the empirical distribution of air time\n\n\n#### Question 2\n\nCalculate the mean and SD of air time in your sample. Assuming the the sampling distribution is roughly normal, what is your 68% confidence interval? Calculate it using these sample statistics.\n\n#### Question 3\n\nDid your interval contain the population mean? This is a rare case where you can check by calculating the average air time of the entire `flights` data set. If you repeated process 100 times - taking many samples and computing many intervals - how many of the resulting intervals would you expect to contain the population mean?\n\n#### Question 4\n\nSelect a second population parameter to estimate, but in this case choose a **proportion** instead of a mean. For example: the proportion of flights that departed ahead of schedule (don't use this example). Using the same sample of flights as before:\n\n1. Mutate a new logical variable that is interesting to you (e.g. whether or not a flight departed ahead of schedule).\n2. Visualize that variable with a ggplot.\n3. Calculate a sample proportion from this variable (see lab 4 for examples of this).\n4. Form a 68% confidence interval, adapting it for a proportion by using the appropriate modifications from the notes (in this case, use your sample proportion).\n\n\n\n#### Question 5\n\nDid your interval contain the population proportion? This is a rare case where you can check by calculating the actual proportion found in the entire `flights` data set. If you repeated process 100 times - taking many samples and computing many intervals - how many of the resulting intervals would you expect to contain the population proportion?\n\n#### Question 6\n\nFor both of the settings above - estimating a population mean and a population proportion - what are *two* things that can be changed to decrease the width of the confidence intervals?\n\n\n#### Question 7\n\nIn these practice problems we treated the `flights` data as the target population (and access frame) then took simple random samples of size 100. In reality, the entire `flights` data set was the sample of data that we investigated in Lab 4.\n\nGive an example of a larger target population to which you would be comfortable generalizing from the full `flights` data set. Provide another example of one to which you would *not* be comfortable generalizing. It may be helpful to sketch scope diagrams.\n",
