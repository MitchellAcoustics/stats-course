Use these and the plot to describe the distribution in words.\n\n#### Question 3\n\nCompare the distribution of city miles per gallon of cars in two groups: 4 cylinder cars and cars with more than four cylinders. Do this graphically and also by calculating the summary statistics of each subgroup.\n\n#### Question 4\n\nPlot the relationship between city miles per gallon,  highway miles per gallon, and a third variable of your choice that is categorical. Describe in words the relationship that you see.\n\n\n#### Challenges\n\n- Redo the plot from question 1 but annotate the plot to include vertical lines that indicate the mean and median mpg.\n\n- Plot the change in average mileage from 1999 to 2008.\n\n- Plot the change in average mileage from 1999 to 2008 comparing cars with 4 cylinders to cars with more than 4 cylinders.",
