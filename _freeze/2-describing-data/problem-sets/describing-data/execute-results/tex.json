This rate is often used as an indicator of the level of health in a country. \nThe relative frequency histogram below (which displays _proportions_ instead of counts) shows the distribution of estimated infant death rates for 224 countries for which such data were available in 2014.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" fig.asp='0.8'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](describing-data_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-2-1.pdf){fig-align='center'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\na.  Estimate Q1 (the median of the first half of the data), the median, and Q3 (the median of the second half of the data) from the histogram.\n\nb.  Would you expect the mean of this dataset to be smaller or larger than the median? Explain your reasoning.\n    \nc. Would the sample standard deviation or the IQR do a better job of measuring the spread of this distribution? Why?\n\n### Question 2: Associations in scatterplots\n\nIndicate which of the plots show (a) a positive association, (b) a negative association, or (c) no association. Also determine if the positive and negative associations are linear or nonlinear. Each part may refer to more than one plot.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" fig.asp='0.3'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](describing-data_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-3-1.pdf){fig-align='center'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Question 3: Practice with ggplot I\n\nThe following three plots come from a data set called `mcu_films` inside the `openintro` package. Please write out the `ggplot2` code that will produce each one. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](describing-data_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-4-1.pdf){fig-align='center'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### Question 4: Practice with ggplot II\n.The following three plots come from the data set `penguins` (from the `palmerpenguins` package, that you have used in class). Please write out the `ggplot2` code that will produce each one.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](describing-data_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-5-1.pdf){fig-align='center'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Question 5: Numerical summaries with an interactive tutorial\n\nThis last problem is rather fun, and comes in the form of an interactive tutorial:\n\n[**Describing Data with Numerical Summaries and Graphics**](https://openintro.shinyapps.io/ims-02-explore-03/)  \n[https://openintro.shinyapps.io/ims-02-explore-03/](https://openintro.shinyapps.io/ims-02-explore-03/)\n\nThere is nothing to submit for this problem set but please attest that you have worked through the tutorial by writing out one of the statements below in your submission:\n\n- \"Yes, I have completed the tutorial\"\n- \"I am working through the tutorial, and will complete it this week.\"\n- \"I have not been able to work on the tutorial.\"\n\n### Question 6: Review\n\nNine-hundred and ten (910) randomly sampled registered voters from Tampa, FL were asked if they thought workers who have illegally entered the US should be (i) allowed to keep their jobs and apply for US citizenship, (ii) allowed to keep their jobs as temporary guest workers but not allowed to apply for US citizenship, or (iii) lose their jobs and have to leave the country. \nThe results of the survey by political ideology are shown below.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begin{table}[H]\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}[t]{lrrr}\n\\toprule\nResponse & Conservative & Liberal & Moderate\\\\\n\\midrule\nApply for citizenship & 57 & 101 & 120\\\\\nGuest worker & 121 & 28 & 113\\\\\nLeave the country & 179 & 45 & 126\\\\\nNot sure & 15 & 1 & 4\\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n:::\n:::\n\n\na.  What percent of these Tampa, FL voters identify themselves as conservatives? Is this a joint, marginal, or conditional proportion?\n\nb.  What percent of these Tampa, FL voters are in favor of the citizenship option? Is this a joint, marginal, or conditional proportion?\n\nc.  What percent of these Tampa, FL voters identify themselves as conservatives and are in favor of the citizenship option? Is this a joint, marginal, or conditional proportion?\n\nd.  What percent of these Tampa, FL voters who identify themselves as conservatives are also in favor of the citizenship option? What percent of moderates share this view? What percent of liberals share this view? Are these joint, marginal, or conditional proportions?\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" fig.asp='0.6'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](describing-data_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-7-1.pdf){fig-align='center'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\ne.  Based on the stacked bar chart shown below, do political ideology and views on immigration appear to be associated? Explain your reasoning.\n    \nf.  Conjecture other possible variables that might explain the potential relationship between these two variables.\n\n\n\n",
