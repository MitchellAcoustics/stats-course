In this unit use, we aim to make claims like the second one, \"The Consumer Price Index will likely rise throughout the summer\". This is a *prediction*, a claim that uses the structure of the data at hand to predict the value of observations about which we have only partial information. In midsummer, we know the date will be July 15th, that's the x-coordinate. But what will the y-coordinate be, the Consumer Price Index?\n\nThe realm of prediction is the subject of intense research activity and commercial investment at the moment. Falling under the terms \"machine learning\" and \"AI\", models for prediction have become very powerful in recent years; they can diagnose diseases, help drive autonomous vehicles, and compose text with eerily human sensibilities. At the core of these complicated models, thought, are a few simple ideas that make it all possible.\n\n![Four types of claims made with data covered in this class.](images/claims-only.png){#fig-claims width=\"500px\"}\n\n\n[^nyt]: Smialek, Jeanna (2022, May 11). Consumer Prices are Still Climbing Rapidly. *The New York Times*. <https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/11/business/economy/april-2022-cpi.html>\n\n## A Simple Linear Model\n\nOur introduction to building a model for prediction begins with a simple question:\n\n> What is the relationship between educational attainment and poverty?\n\nAs framed, this question is so general as to be challenging to answer convincingly. To make the question more tractable, let's start from the other end: what data could be brought to bear on this question?\n\nThe `poverty` data frame contains data from the 50 US states (plus the District of Columbia) with two variables observed on each: the percentage of the population living below the poverty line and the percentage of current residents who have graduated from high school.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"false\"}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\npoverty <- read_csv(\"https://tinyurl.com/stat20poverty\")\npoverty\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 51 × 3\n   State                Poverty Graduates\n   <chr>                  <dbl>     <dbl>\n 1 Alabama                 14.6      79.9\n 2 Alaska                   8.3      90.6\n 3 Arizona                 13.3      83.8\n 4 Arkansas                18        80.9\n 5 California              12.8      81.1\n 6 Colorado                 9.4      88.7\n 7 Connecticut              7.8      87.5\n 8 Delaware                 8.1      88.7\n 9 District of Columbia    16.8      86  \n10 Florida                 12.1      84.7\n# … with 41 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWith this data set, we can start by addressing the more specific question:\n\n> What is the relationship between the poverty rate and the high school graduation rate among the 50 US states plus DC?\n\nA good first start to answering this question is to perform some exploratory data analysis and visualize the relationship using a natural choice for two numerical variables: a scatter plot.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npoverty %>%\n    ggplot(aes(x = Poverty,\n               y = Graduates)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    theme_bw()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](notes_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nA good second step might be to summarizing the strength of this relationship with a statistic: the Pearson correlation coefficient.\n\nFor the remainder of these notes, we'll turn you over to two lectures that can now be found under \"Media Gallery\" in Stat 20 - Main on bCourses.
