The data frame below provides a training data set containing five observations, two numerical predictors, and one categorical response variable.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ c | c | c | c }
  \hline
  Obs. & $X_1$ & $X_2$ & $Y$ \\
  \hline
  1 & 2 & 210 & Orange \\
  2 & 0 & 90 & Blue \\
  3 & 1 & -23 & Orange \\
  4 & 0 & 180 & Blue \\
  5 & 1.2 & 312 & Orange \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

1. Using K Nearest Neighbors with $K = 2$, based on Euclidean distance, predict the class of a new test observation with $x_1 = -1; \quad x_2 = 255$. It may be helpful to sketch a scatterplot of this data.

2. Does this method incorporate the information of each predictor equally? If so, how? If not, how would you tweak the method so that it does?
