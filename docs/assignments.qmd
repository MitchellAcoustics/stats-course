## Problem Sets

#### PDF handouts

1. Create a file called `ps.qmd` alongside the notes for a given day's materials. Your directory should look like this:

   ```markdown
   intro-to-probability
   ├── notes.qmd
   ├── ps.qmd
   ```
2. At least two YAML options should be specified in the front-matter, `title` and the custom handout `format`:

   ```yaml
   ---
   title: Calculating Chances
   format: stat20handout-pdf
   ---
   ```
3. Upon rendering the site, this assignment should appear on the assignments page. The format of the assignment list is controlled by the [assignments template](https://github.com/stat20/stat20/blob/main/assets/listings/assignments-ps.ejs#L4), which will automatically assign numbers to the problem sets based on their order in the directory.


#### Qmd handouts

1. Just like with pdfs, create a file called `ps.qmd` alongside the notes for a given day's materials. Your directory should look like this:

   ```markdown
   intro-to-probability
   ├── notes.qmd
   ├── ps.qmd
   ```
2. Just one option needs to be specified in the front-matter, `title`:

   ```yaml
   ---
   title: Simulation
   ---
   ```
3. Open up the [`_quarto.yml`](https://github.com/stat20/stat20/blob/main/_quarto.yml) file and add the path to this file under the `project: render:` list preprended with a `!`. It should look something like this.

   ```yaml
   project:
     type: website
     resources:
       - "homepage-readings"
     render:
       - "*.qmd"
       - "!3-probability/intro-to-probability/ps.qmd"
   ```
   This will ignore that file during rendering.
4. Upon rendering the site, your `ps.qmd` will be ignored from the render process, making it available as an ordinary qmd file. This has the current side-effect of not propagating the title of the qmd into the assignment listings but that's ok.
