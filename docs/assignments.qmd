title: Adding and Removing Assignments
toc-depth: 4
---

Assignments are hosted on the [Assignments](assignments.qmd) page and include a list of Labs and a list of Problem Sets. These lists build automatically if the assignment files are named and place according to a set structure. Below we discuss how to add assignments to the lists. They can be removed by renaming the files or removing them entirely from the repository.

For further reading on how these lists are made, see the Quarto documentation on [document listings](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-listings.html).

## Problem Sets

#### PDF handouts

1. Create a file called `ps.qmd` alongside the notes for a given day's materials. Your directory should look like this:

   ```markdown
   intro-to-probability
   ├── notes.qmd
   ├── ps.qmd
   ```
2. At least two YAML options should be specified in the front-matter, `title` and the custom handout `format`:

   ```yaml
   ---
   title: Calculating Chances
   format: stat20handout-pdf
   ---
   ```
3. Upon rendering the site, this assignment should appear on the assignments page. The format of the assignment list is controlled by the [assignments template](https://github.com/stat20/stat20/blob/main/assets/listings/assignments-ps.ejs#L4), which will automatically assign numbers to the problem sets based on their order in the directory.

The pdf notes use the `stat20handout` custom pdf format. See [Custom Formats](docs/custom-formats.qmd) for more information on its use.

#### Qmd handouts

1. Just like with pdfs, create a file called `ps.qmd` alongside the notes for a given day's materials. Your directory should look like this:

   ```markdown
   intro-to-probability
   ├── notes.qmd
   ├── ps.qmd
   ```
2. Just one option needs to be specified in the front-matter, `title`:

   ```yaml
   ---
   title: Simulation
   ---
   ```
3. Open up the [`_quarto.yml`](https://github.com/stat20/stat20/blob/main/_quarto.yml) file and add the path to this file under the `project: render:` list preprended with a `!`. It should look something like this.

   ```yaml
   project:
     type: website
     resources:
       - "homepage-readings"
     render:
       - "*.qmd"
       - "!3-probability/intro-to-probability/ps.qmd"
   ```
   This will ignore that file during rendering.
4. Upon rendering the site, your `ps.qmd` will be ignored from the render process, making it available as an ordinary qmd file. This has the current side-effect of not propagating the title of the qmd into the assignment listings but that's ok.

If you have multiple problem set files on a single day, you can differentiate them using `ps1.qmd`, `ps2.qmd`, i.e. a digit directly following `ps`. See the source for the [assignment page](https://github.com/stat20/stat20/blob/main/assignments.qmd) for the rule that determines which files show up in the listing.
