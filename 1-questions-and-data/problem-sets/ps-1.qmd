---

This is a problem set in three parts, each of which is submitted separately to Gradescope. Parts 2 and 3 are part of class Friday.

### PS 1.1: Course Surveys

Please fill out the following two surveys:

1. [Welcome to Class](https://forms.gle/oS7uKfKRvPwj1DbBA)
1. [Data Collection](https://forms.gle/aEVYreH3XxUmZovf8)

then go to Gradescope to attest to having completed them.

### PS 1.2: Taxonomy of Data Worksheet

Check back Friday morning.

<!-- [Link to paper worksheet](). Please write answers by hand on the worksheet (or via tablet) and scan to a pdf for submission. Please use a pdf scanning app instead of just taking a photo (these ones are very hard for us to read and grade). -->

### PS 1.3: Getting Started with Markdown

Check back Friday morning.

<!-- [Link to .qmd file](../02-taxonomy-of-data/_worksheet-digital.qmd). Download the `_worksheet-quarto.qmd` to your computer, then upload to RStudio (click the link in the upper right of the course page to get your RStudio account).  -->
