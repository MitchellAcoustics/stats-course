# Concept Questions


## Educated Guess 1

:::{.poll}
What will happen here?

\

Answer at `pollev.com/<name>`
:::

\

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

a <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
sqrt(log(a))
```

```{r}
countdown::countdown(1, top = 0)
```

:::{.notes}
Talking points
- a is a vector of length four
- log and sqrt are functions that will return vectors of length four
- they're nested and will be evaluated from the inside out

## Educated Guess 2

:::{.poll}
What will happen here?

\

Answer at `pollev.com/<name>`
:::

\

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

a <- 1 + 2
a + 1
```

```{r}
countdown::countdown(1, top = 0)
```

:::{.notes}
- a is a not a string, it's the name of an object that's a number
- to overwrite a with `a + 1` requires re-assigning it to a: `a <- a + 1` (in some languages, `a + 1` would change the value of a)
- `a <- a + 1` is a good time to mention that while `a = a + 1` works in R and they might see it online, its convention to use <- for many reasons including that mathematically the statement with = is confusing.

## Educated Guess 3

:::{.poll}
What will happen here?

\

Answer at `pollev.com/<name>`
:::

\

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, error = TRUE}
1 + "one"
```

```{r}
countdown::countdown(1, top = 0)
```

:::{.notes}
- "one" is a string with no link at all to the number 1
- without that link, without two objects that are recognized for their numerical value, `+` doesn't work.
:::

## Educated Guess 4

:::{.poll}
What will happen here?

\

Answer at `pollev.com/<name>`
:::

\

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| error: true

a <- c(1, 3.14, "seven")
class(a)
```

```{r}
countdown::countdown(1, top = 0)
```

:::{.notes}
- the definition of a vector requires every element to be of the same type
- based on their reading, there are three classes that they're familiar with: numeric, factor, and character
- there's no way to translate "seven" into 7, so instead 1 and 3.14 must be translated into strings
- they will likely encounter this when looking at a data set in R (or other languages) and finding that vectors with what looked like numbers are stored as strings. This usually happens because there's a single errant character that the language doesn't know how to parse as a number.
