# Concept Questions

## 

You embark on a mission to estimate a population mean used a simple random sample of $n$ observations.

:::poll
What sample size would you need to increase the precision of your estimate by 3x compared to the original sample?
:::

:::notes
A. n + 3
B. 3n
D. n + 6
C. 6n
D. 9n

This assesses the 1/sqrt(n) relationship between the SE and the SD. It appeared in the Reading Questions in a slightly different form, but is likely worth talking through together.

## 

An economist aims to estimate the average weekly cost of groceries per household in two cites: Grimes, CA (population ~400) and Tranquility, CA (population ~800). Both of these populations of households are presumed to have a similar standard deviation of weekly grocery costs. The demographer takes a simple random sample (without replacement) of 30 households from each city, records their costs, and computes a 95% confidence interval for the average weekly cost.

:::poll
Approximately how much wider would Tranquility's confidence interval be than Grimes's?

## 

An economist aims to estimate the average weekly cost of groceries per household in two cites: Oakland, CA (population ~400,000) and Fremont, CA (population ~200,000). Both of these populations of households are presumed to have a similar standard deviation of weekly grocery costs. The economist takes a simple random sample (without replacement) of 30 households from each city, records their costs, and computes a 95% confidence interval for the average weekly cost.

:::poll
Approximately how much wider would Oakland's confidence interval be than Fremont's?

:::notes
A. 1.5 times as wide
B. 2 times as wide
C. 3 times as wide
D. 4 times as wide
E. The same width
