For each question below do the following:

-   Are there ways to improve how the content was communicated?

# Question 1: stat20 website

Critique our course website, [www.stat20.org/](https://www.stat20.org/) (either the whole website or a specific part e.g. one set of notes/slides, etc).

# Question 2: a data visualization

Any data visualization. Could be something in our course or anywhere else.

# Question 3: something else

Choose a piece of public communication. This could be anything e.g. a news article, a website, a visualization, etc. Post a link to the piece so we can see what you are talking about. For example, you could pick [AirBnB's pitch deck to venture capitalists](https://www.slideshare.net/PitchDeckCoach/airbnb-first-pitch-deck-editable).
