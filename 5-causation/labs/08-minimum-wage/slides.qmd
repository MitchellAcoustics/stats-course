<!--## Minimum wage and employment

- The headline is making a causal claim about wages and employment.

- Common reasoning:
   - if restaurant owners operate on a fixed budget, they have 
only so much money available to pay employees.
  - Higher wages means fewer employees can share the pot.
  
- Since many fast food employees make minimum wage, changes to minimum wage
laws might impact fast food employment levels.-->

## Case study: New Jersey, 1992

- New Jersey raises minimum wage to \$5.05 per hour.
- This gives it the highest minimum wage in the country.  
- Local business leaders strongly oppose the change.
- Neighboring state of Pennsylvania does not change its minimum wage.

- To study the impact of law on employment levels, David Card and Alan Krueger surveyed 410 fast-food restaurants in Pennsylvania and New Jersey
- First wave of survey results collected Feb-March 1992 (before change).
- Second wave of results from same restaurants collected Nov-Dec 1992 (after change).
- Variable names from second set of surveys are coded in the data with
a "\_2" at the end.
