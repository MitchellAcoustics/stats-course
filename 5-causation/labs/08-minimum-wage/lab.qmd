## Part II: Computing on the Data

<!-- Q1-6 on context and Q1-X on computing can be done on Day 1-->
<!-- Day 2 material needed for Q7-9 on context and rest of computing Qs-->

Card and Krueger's data from both survey waves is contained in the
data frame `min_wage`.


1. For our response in this study, we will follow Card and Krueger's main analysis and use ``full time equivalent" employment in the second survey wave.  This is the number of full time employees plus half the number of part-time employees. Extract a data frame that contains only this response variable, the state variable, and the covariates. 

2. Make a Love plot showing balance between Pennsylvania and New Jersey stores on the covariates you picked for special scrutiny in Part I.  How does this plot look similar or different to the sketch you made for Part I?

2. Conduct a balance test for one of the variables in your Love plot and interpret the result.

3. Use the `matchit` command to create a matched comparison between
New Jersey restaurants and Pennsylvania restaurants. HOW TO DEAL WITH 
NAs AND MORE TREATED THAN CONTROLS?  SOMETHING ABOUT PLOTTING?  Create an updated version of the Love plot that includes balance measures after matching and compare it to your earlier plot.  How successful has matching been in creating comparable groups?

4. Write an `infer` pipeline to estimate an average treatment effect of state (here
used as a proxy for minimum wage increase) on full-time effective
employment, and to test whether it differs significantly from zero. 
Summarize what your analysis says about the causal claim from Part I,
making sure to mention any important assumptions on which you are 
relying.

5. Now extract a new dataframe from the original data set that contains only New Jersey restaurants.  Compute full-time effective
employment for both survey waves and use them to construct a pre/post
estimate of the average effect of the minimum wage increase.

6. Bootstrap your pre/post estimate to generate a 95\% confidence interval.  Does this analysis agree or disagree in general with the 
matched analysis of question 4?  If there is a difference
in the results, how might the differing assumptions underlying
the two methods explain any disagreement? 

7.  Now return to the main dataset and make a line plot showing average
change in full-time effective employment separately for New Jersey and
for Pennsylvania restaurants.  How does this plot agree or disagree 
with the anticipated pattern you sketched in Part I?

8. Use a difference-in-difference approach to estimate the average
effect of the minimum wage increase on full-time effective employment, and provide a bootstrap 95\% confidence interval.

9. Write a two-paragraph executive summary about your
three analyses, their strengths and limitations, and the overall message they provide. Based on your results, would you recommend Californiaâ€™s state legislature to raise the minimum wage, or would this risk eliminating large numbers of low-wage jobs?  Be careful to think about the role of both generalization and causal claims in answering this question.
