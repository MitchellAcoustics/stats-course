#### Question 1:  Expected value from cdf of $X$
Given the cdf of the random variable $X$ below, compute $E(X)$ and $Var(X)$. Note that:

$$
F(x) = \begin{cases}
			0, & \text{$x < -1$}\\
            0.4, & -1 \le x < 1 \\
            0.8, & 1 \le x < 2 \\
            1, & 2 \le x \\
		 \end{cases}
$$

#### Question 2: How many red tickets 

A box of 100 tickets contains 45 red tickets, 50 blue tickets,
  and 5 yellow tickets. Twenty tickets will be drawn from this box at
  random, with replacement. What is the expected number of red tickets in the sample?

#### Question 3: Expectations of linear transformations

Let $X$ be a random variable such that $E(X) = 4$. Let $Y = 2 + 3X$. What is $E(Y)$?

#### Question 4: Continuous random variables

Consider the function $f(x)$ where:
$$
f(x) = \begin{cases}
x+1, \: -1 \le x \le 0\\
1-x, \: 0 \le x \le 1 \\
0, \: \text{ for all other }x
\end{cases}
$$

(a) Does $f$ satisfy the criteria to be a probability density function? (It should be non-negative and integrate to 1, that is, the total area under the curve is 1.)

(b) What is your guess for $E(X)$, without doing any integration or summation?

#### Question 5: Sums of random variables

A discrete random variable $X$ takes values from $-5$ to $5$ with $E(X) = 0$ and $SD(X) = 3$. Define $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ to be independent random variables with the same distribution as $X$. 

(i) Does this mean (for example) that if we know that $X = 1$, we know that $X_k = 1$ for all of $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$? Why or why not?

(ii) Let $n = 100$ and consider $S_{100} = X_1 + X_2 + \ldots + X_{100}$. What is the expected value and SD of $S_{100}$?

\vspace{3cm}

(iii) Now, let $n = 200$, so $S_{200} =  X_1 + X_2 + \ldots + X_{200}$. Is $SD(S_{200}) = 2 SD(S_{100})$? Explain your answer.
