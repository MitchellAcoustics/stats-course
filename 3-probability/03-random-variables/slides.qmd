## Agenda

- PS 8: time to work on it and then review
- Brief lecture and CQs on Random Variables
- Break
- PS 9 (random variables)
- If time, coin flipping graph


# PS 8

# Lecture

## Random variables 


:::{.incremental}
- Let $X$ be the number of heads in three tosses of a fair coin.

- What about if $X$ is the number of heads in 3 tosses of a biased coin, where the chance of heads is $\frac{2}{3}$?

- Now suppose we toss a fair coin until the first time it lands heads, and let $X$ be the number of tosses. What is the pmf of $X$? Is it binomial?

- Finally, let's consider a deck of cards, and we are interested in the number of hearts dealt in a hand of five. Call this number $X$. What is the pmf of $X$?
:::

:::{.notes}
Write out outcome space of 3 coin flips of a fair coin and use this to define rv X = number of heads. Write out the pmf and cdf, and draw the cdf. Show why $X$ is binomial and what are $n$ ad $p$

Show what happens if coin is unfair. How the probabilities change.

Demo dbinom and pbinom and connection to pmf and cdf.

## $f(x)$ and $F(x)$


:::{.incremental}

- $f(x)$ is the probability mass function of $X$. What does that mean? What is the connection to the distribution table? The probability histogram?

- $F(x)$ is the cumulative distribution function. 

- What is the connection between $f$ and $F$?

:::

:::{.notes}
Draw an example on the board. Maybe box of tickets { 0, 0, 0 , 1, 1, 2, 2, 2} draw one ticket, and let $X$ be the value of the ticket.

# Concept Questions

##

```{r}
countdown::countdown(1, bottom = 0)
```

Is the following random variable binomial (if so, what are $n$ and $p$?), hypergeometric (if so , what are $N$, $G$, and $n$?), or neither?

\

Roll a fair ten-sided die 20 times. Let $X$ be the number of times we roll a multiple of 3.

\

:::{.poll}
Binomial, hypergeometric, or neither? 
:::

:::{.notes}
Binomial(20, 3/10). The pollev will have three choices, and then figuring out the parameters can be a classroom discussion.

YouGov surveyed about 1,900 adults and asked them if they thought that Kevin Mcarthy should be ousted from his role as speaker. Let $X$ be the number of people who responded "Yes". The population of the US is about 335 million.


:::{.poll}
Binomial, hypergeometric, or neither? 
:::

:::{.notes}
Hypergeometric($N = 335$ mill,  $n = 1900$, G), where G is not known, being the number of people who approve of McCarthy's ouster  . Can remark that we could use Bin to model this rather than HG, and that we will discuss samples next week.

\

A six-sided die is tossed two times and the sum of the faces showing is $8$. Let $X$ be 1 if the sum is $8$ and $0$ otherwise.

\


:::{.poll}
Binomial, hypergeometric, or neither? 
:::


:::{.notes}
Binomial, with $n = 1, p = 5/36$ or Bernoulli with $p = 5/36$. This was part of the handout but I think some classroom discussion is warranted, so moved it here.

A bag that has 6 pieces of fruit: 2 mangoes, 3 apples, and 1 orange. I reach into the bag and draw out one fruit at a time, selecting each fruit at random (so they are equally likely). Let $X$ be the number of draws until and including the first time I draw a apple. 


:::{.poll}
Binomial, hypergeometric, or neither? 
:::



:::{.notes}
Neither. It would be useful at this point to write out the pmf of $X$, and point out that they are using the multiplication rule and a conditional probability.

You have $10$ people with a cold and you have a remedy with a $20\%$ chance of success. What is the chance that your remedy will cure at least *one* sufferer? (Let $X$ be the number of people cured among the 10. We are looking for the probability that $X \ge 1$)


:::{.poll}
What is the chance that at least one person is cured?
:::

:::{.notes}
$P(X \ge 1) = 1 - P(X < 1) = 1 - P(X = 0) = 1 - (1-p)^{10}$, where $p = 0.2$, because $X \sim Bin(10, p)$. $1-p = 0.8 \: \& \: 1-0.8^{10} = 0.8926$

Roll a pair of fair six-sided dice and let $X = 1$ if the dice land showing the same number of spots, and $0$ otherwise. For example, if both dice land $2$, then $X = 1$, but if one lands $2$ and the other lands $3$, then $X = 0$. 

:::{.poll}
What is $P(X=1)$? 
:::



:::{.notes}
The chance that $X = 1$ can be broken up into six mutually exclusive situations, that the dice both show one spot, or both show two spots, etc. Each of these has probability $1/36$ so the total probability by the addition rule is $6/36 = 1/6$
