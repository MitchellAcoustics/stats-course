@. If we want to simulate rolling a pair of dice and summing the spots (for say, playing Monopoly), will the following code do this correctly? Explain.

```{r}
#| eval: false
# first create a vector with the possible sums of a pair of dice
dice <- c(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12)
# then sample once from dice
sample(dice, 1)

```

@. If we are defining a box to simulate tossing a fair coin three times and counting the **number** of heads, would either of the methods below work? If not, why not? (Note that, for example, the box  $\fbox{\fbox{0} \fbox{1}}$  would be represented by the `(0, 1)` in R, and we would then use the function `sample()`.

(a) $\fbox{\fbox{0} \fbox{1}}$ - Draw three times at random with replacement, and sum the draws.
(b) $\fbox{\fbox{0} \fbox{1} \fbox{2} \fbox{3}}$ -  Draw once, the result is the number of heads.

@. One ticket will be drawn at random from each of the two boxes below:

\begin{center}
$A: \fbox{\fbox{1} \fbox{2} \fbox{3}}$ $\hspace{1cm}$ $B: \fbox{ \fbox{1} \fbox{2} \fbox{3} \fbox{4}}$
\end{center}

   (a) What is the probability the number drawn from $A$ is greater than the one drawn from $B$?

   \
   
   \

   (b) What is the probability that the number drawn from $A$ is equal to the one drawn from $B$?

   \
   
   \

   (c) What is the probability the number drawn from $A$ is smaller than the one drawn from $B$?

@. I want to estimate the proportion of people in Berkeley who speak at least two languages. I stand at the corner of University and Shattuck and ask each person who goes by how many languages they speak, and keep a count of how many speak at least two. Is this a good way to estimate the proportion I am looking for?

@.  

(a) Consider the box $\fbox{ \fbox{1} \fbox{2} \fbox{2} \fbox{3} \fbox{4}}$. I draw two tickets at random **with** replacement. If my first draw is a 2, what is the probability that my second draw is a 3?

\

\

(b) Consider the box $\fbox{ \fbox{1} \fbox{2} \fbox{2} \fbox{3} \fbox{4}}$. I draw two tickets at random **without** replacement. If my first draw is a 2, what is the probability that my second draw is a 3?

@. Consider an outcome space $\Omega$ and events $A, B, C$ with $P(A) = 0.6$, $P(B) = 0.7$.

(a) What is the smallest possible value of $P(A \cap B) = P(A \textbf{ and } B)$

\
\

(b) What is the largest possible value of $P(A \cap B)$?

\
\

(c) What is the smallest possible value of $P(A \cup B)$? 

\
\

(d) What is the largest possible value of $P(A \cup B)$? 

\
\

@. Think about the two types of plots you saw in the notes: the empirical distributions and the actual probability distribution for the outcomes of rolling a fair six-sided die. Suppose we play a game now: we roll a die $n$ times, and you get 5 dollars if the proportion of times you roll a 6 is greater than 20%. You get to choose $n$ to be either 10 or 1000. Which one would you choose? Why?
